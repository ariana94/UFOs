# UFOs

## :alien: ***The Truth is Out There***:alien:
Dana has always been fascinated in UFOs since 1950 when she heard about a farm's UFO sighting. In this project, I will be assiting Dana in analyzing data from a JavaScript file full of sighting information. We will be using JavaScript to create a table with a user input filter to search through for specific results. All of this will come together on our website that we will put together using HTML.

## The Site of Sightings

![main site](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19378130/182984323-4c232a64-766f-4ac0-bced-b5b3238dd1bb.PNG)

Untouched, the website shows all the data from our JS file, sorted by date. When using the filter table, it fuctions the best when information is entered from top to bottom in lowercase letters and will start filtering results immediatley.

Date must be entered first

Followed by city, state, and country

You can even specify the shape

Once you are ready to clear the results or get back to the main page, you can click the page name in the top left corner to refresh the page.

## How can this site become out of this world?
One of the biggest issues I see currently is the search option. It would be better for users to be able to enter only some information to such by, such as just the date, or only the shape. Currently all the filter boxes must filled out in order and you can not skip boxes.

Some future implements that would benefit the site could be the ability to import live data from websites that take in the UFO reports. This could be done with WebScraping and JSON. It would also be great if there were sort options on the table itself to quickly sort all the columns in an ascending and descending style.
